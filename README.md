# VHDL-Washing-Machine-Simulation
This VHDL project was made in my first year at uni alongside with one of my colleague @HolyCrusader2004

The main theme of this VHDL project is the simulation of a fully running washing machine.

In this repository you can find the documentation along with the components (.circ) that builds into the final product.
